Spatial analysis - calculating delta % between cellular phenotypes among k nearest neighbours
spatial_sample.txt -  sample data from three high-power microscopic images of DLBCL cases. input data consists of
a) id - sample id
b) label - different phenotypes / grouping
d) x and y - spatial coordiantes for each cell.

Number of k neighbours can be defined at the beginning of the process.

Summary results sheet provides results for interactions among all phenotypes for each sample.
